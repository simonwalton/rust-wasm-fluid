# 💦🦀 Rust/WASM Fluid Simulation

## Why?

A fun project for me as I learn the basics of Rust. Don't expect idiomatic or good Rust code in this repo.

There are numerous better Naiver-Stokes solvers out there that'll run on GPUs, such as [fluid.js](https://github.com/malik-tillman/Fluid-JS). 

## Live demo

The static assets are published using Github Pages here. 

## Usage

### 🛠️ Build the Rust to WASM

```
wasm-pack build
```

### 🛠️ Run the dev web server

```
npm run start
```
